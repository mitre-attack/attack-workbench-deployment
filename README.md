# ATT\&CK Workbench Deployment Guide

This repository provides a ready-to-use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) setup for deploying the [ATT\&CK Workbench](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend) application and its related services.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-deployment.git
   cd attack-workbench-deployment
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cp configs/rest-api/template.env configs/rest-api/.env
   # (Optional) For TAXII support:
   cp configs/taxii/config/template.env configs/taxii/config/.env
   ```

3. **Start the Workbench application**:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **(Optional) Start with TAXII server**:

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile with-taxii up -d
   ```

## üß† What Is This?

The ATT\&CK Workbench is composed of several services:

* A **Frontend UI**
* A **REST API backend**
* A **MongoDB** database
* An optional **TAXII 2.1 Server**

This repository lets you deploy all of them using Docker Compose. You can choose to:

* ‚úÖ Use **published Docker images** (default and recommended)
* üõ†Ô∏è Or **build from source** (for development or customization)

## üîÑ Version Compatibility

The ATT&CK Workbench services are tied to specific versions of the ATT&CK Specification, maintained by the [ATT&CK Data Model](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-data-model). Each release of the Workbench frontend and REST API aligns with a major version of the ATT&CK Specification.

Please refer to the [COMPATIBILITY.md](./COMPATIBILITY.md) file for a complete compatibility matrix.

## üß© Deployment Options

### 1. **Using Published Docker Images** ‚úÖ

This is the default mode and best for most users. No need to clone or modify Workbench source code ‚Äî the Compose file pulls prebuilt images directly from the GitHub Container Registry:

```yaml
services:
  rest-api:
    image: ghcr.io/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api:latest
```

### 2. **Building from Source** (Advanced)

If you want to customize or test unreleased changes, you can modify the `compose.yaml` to build images locally:

```yaml
services:
  rest-api:
    build: ../attack-workbench-rest-api
```

> **Note**: The provided Compose file is preconfigured for published images but can be adapted to support builds.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### REST API `.env`

Edit the `.env` file at `configs/rest-api/.env` to configure the backend.

Example:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://attack-workbench-database/attack-workspace
AUTHN_MECHANISM=anonymous
```

Optional: You can also provide a JSON config file and reference it via:

```env
JSON_CONFIG_PATH=configs/rest-api/rest-api-service-config.json
```

### TAXII Server (Optional)

The TAXII 2.1 server is an optional sidecar service to expose ATT\&CK data via the TAXII protocol.

1. Use `.env` files to configure the server:

   * `configs/taxii/config/.env` (default)
   * or use the `TAXII_ENV` variable to load `dev.env`, `prod.env`, etc.

2. Example environment config usage:

```env
TAXII_ENV=prod
```

3. If enabling HTTPS:

   * Provide PEM files:

     ```
     configs/taxii/config/private-key.pem
     configs/taxii/config/public-certificate.pem
     ```
   * OR base64-encode and set them via:

     ```env
     TAXII_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64>
     TAXII_SSL_PUBLIC_KEY=<base64>
     ```

## üß™ Docker Compose Profiles

Use Compose profiles to include or exclude the optional TAXII service:

* With TAXII:

  ```bash
  docker compose --profile with-taxii up -d
  ```

* Without TAXII:

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```

The `with-taxii` profile is defined in [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml).

## üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing / Development

If you're working on ATT\&CK Workbench source code:

* Clone the relevant service repositories
* Modify the `compose.yaml` to build from local source (`build:` instead of `image:`)
* Use volume mounts for live reloading if needed
