# ATT&CK Workbench Development Process

## Overview

This document outlines the development and release process for the ATT&CK Workbench ecosystem, including branch management, release channels, and deployment strategies.

## Scope

This process applies to all ATT&CK Workbench ecosystem projects:

- [ATT&CK Workbench Frontend](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend)
- [ATT&CK Workbench REST API](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api)
- [ATT&CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 Server](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server)
- [ATT&CK Data Model](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-data-model)

## Release Management

### Semantic Versioning

We strictly follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes

### Automated Releases

- **Tool**: [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) automates version management and package publishing
- **Artifacts**: 
  - Docker images published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
  - NPM packages published to the [official npm registry](https://npmjs.com)
- **Triggers**: Releases are triggered by commits to stable branches following conventional commit format

### Semantic Release Plugins

The default semantic-release configuration includes:
1. `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer` - Analyzes commits to determine version bump
2. `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator` - Generates changelog
3. `@semantic-release/npm` - Updates package.json and publishes to registry
4. `@semantic-release/github` - Creates GitHub releases and tags
5. `@semantic-release/exec` - Executes Docker build and push commands

## Branch Strategy

### Stable Branches

These branches are guaranteed to compile, run, and be deployable via Docker:

| Branch | Version | Purpose | Deployment Target |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `main` | 4.0.0 | Production-ready releases | Production, Pre-Production |
| `next` | 4.1.0 | Upcoming minor releases | Pre-Production |
| `next-major` | 5.x | Breaking changes & experimental features | Preview |

### Unstable Branches (Pre-release Channels)

Each stable branch has corresponding pre-release channels for testing:

| Stable Branch | Alpha Channel | Beta Channel | Purpose |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| `main` | `alpha` | `beta` | Hotfix testing |
| `next` | `next-alpha` | `next-beta` | Feature testing |
| `next-major` | `next-major-alpha` | `next-major-beta` | Experimental testing |

## Development Workflow

| Change Type | Target Branch | Example |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **Hotfixes** | `alpha` → `beta` → `main` | Critical bug fixes |
| **Features** (backwards compatible) | `next-alpha` → `next-beta` → `next` | New endpoints, UI components |
| **Breaking Changes** | `next-major-alpha` → `next-major-beta` → `next-major` | API redesigns, major refactors |

### Release Flow

1. **Development**: Features developed in feature branches
2. **Pre-release Testing**: Merged to alpha channel for initial testing
3. **Beta Testing**: Promoted to beta channel for wider testing
4. **Stable Release**: Merged to stable branch, triggering automatic release
5. **Deployment**: Docker images deployed to appropriate environments

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automatically:
1. Runs tests on all pull requests
2. Executes semantic-release on commits to stable branches
3. Builds and publishes Docker images to ghcr.io
4. Tags releases in GitHub

## Code Quality Standards

### Linting & Formatting

| Tool | Purpose | When Run |
|------|---------|----------|
| **ESLint** | Code linting | Pre-commit (auto-fix), CI pipeline |
| **Prettier** | Code formatting | Pre-commit (auto-fix) |
| **Commitlint** | Conventional commit format | Commit-msg hook, CI pipeline |

### Git Hooks (via Husky)

| Hook | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **pre-commit** | `npm run format` | Auto-fix linting and formatting |
| **pre-push** | `npm run test` | Ensure tests pass before push |
| **commit-msg** | `commitlint --edit` | Validate commit message format |

## Contributing

For detailed information on contributing to the ATT&CK Workbench, including commit message formats, development workflow, and coding standards, please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Version Management

- The `version` field in `package.json` is set to `0.0.0-semantically-released`
- Actual versions are managed entirely by semantic-release
- Never manually update version numbers
